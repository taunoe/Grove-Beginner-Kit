# Grove Beginner Kit for Arduino

## Wha it is

Arduino compatible board: Seeeduino Lotus (ATmega m328p).

### Modules

All the modules have been connected to the MCU (microcontroller unit) through the PCB (printed circuit board) stamp holes. So no cables are needed to connect. Of course, you can also take the modules out and use cables.

## STEAM education

* Science
* Technology
* Engineering
* Arts
* Mathematics

Steam education teaches innovation, to think critically and use engineering or technology in imaginative designs or creative approaches to real-world problems while building on students' mathematics and science base. If you like to build hardware then there is not much to do.


## Conclusion

If you are interested to learn embedded programming then this is a good starting point. All modules are already wired and it will make troubleshooting easier.
